# Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition (MLPR) Course Exercises

This repository contains my attempts at the exercises from the Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition (MLPR) course offered by Edinburgh University.

## Overview

The MLPR course covers various topics in machine learning and pattern recognition, including:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Probabilistic Models
- Neural Networks
- Dimensionality Reduction

## Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different exercise or set of exercises from the course. Inside each folder, you will find:

- **Code**: Implementations of the exercise solutions.
- **Data**: Any datasets used for the exercises.
- **Documentation**: Additional notes and explanations related to the exercises.

## Usage

To run the code for a specific exercise, navigate to the corresponding folder and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that folder.
